title: Veganism is morally superior

Let me start by saying that I am (regrettably) not vegan — I don't eat animal flesh, but on occasion I will consume other animal products. I do, however, BELIEVE in veganism, and am slowly working to eliminate all animal exploitation from my life. Yes, the dissonance hurts. Yes, the animals hurt worse.

For many trying years (since ~2012) I was “vegetarian for the environment”, and SURPRISE it never really stuck — I would always regress after about 6 months, and try again in 8. It’s hard to care about the “environment” when you come face-to-face with the futility of your efforts. Which breeds the BIGGEST demon in the “green veggie” moral superiority complex: it is WAY TOO easy to say “Oh it’s just a little chicken, it’ll be thrown out otherwise” or “Gee what’s one burger gonna do? It’s local meat after all!” Blink again — you’re roasting a lamb over a spit (sadly, speaking from experience here).

Then, there was the “plant-based for health” era (less of an “era” and more of a “my doctor told me to do it to lower my cholesterol” type beat). I ate nothing but plants for 6 months, it wasn’t too difficult, and then it…actually worked. Much to my surprise. My cholesterol levels were in the normal range for the first time since I was at least 5 years old. Aaaaaaaand then the “in moderation” demon struck again, I blinked again and this time found myself roasting a pig.

Then I got cats.
