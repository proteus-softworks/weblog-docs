title: Emacs isn’t better than vim
pubDate: 01 Dec 2025

I am typing this in Emacs. I love Emacs. I live in Emacs. I’ve been hacking on Emacs for nearly 15 years. And still: vim is just as good. So is Zed. So is VSCode (ethics aside…). Sure it would probably be prudent to “learn your tool” or whatever, but if you’re a hotshot programmer pigeon typing in Notepad++ then do your thing. Use what you like, not everybody wants to paint the bike-shed.

HOWEVER, if you have zero opinions on our trade — a favorite editor, library preferences, little tricks you swear by, functional or OOP, whatever — I probably won’t work with you.
