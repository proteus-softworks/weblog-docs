I have a tendency to start new hobbies, leave projects half finished, convince myself that THIS is MY thing — to “dabble”. It is honestly exhausting and at times (read: almost always) embarrassing. Thankfully — through what could only be considered “maturity” — I’ve come to terms with my dilettantism, and with some reflection have noticed that a handful of the repeat offenders managed to take root in the rocky, alkaline soil of my brain. And I’m PROUD of my little garden.

As much as I want to salt the earth where the withered stalks of false-starts, half-attempts, and dunning-krugers litter the rest of the garden, I won’t. I couldn’t even do it if I really REALLY wanted to. At least not idiomatically. I’m old enough to know that I’ll inevitably just get distracted researching which plants thrive in this new, differently fucked up soil — and so the cycle continues. Instead, I’ll inevitably continue scattering whatever seeds I happen upon, and maybe they’ll take root too. They probably won’t. And that’s fine because at least they’ll keep me in the garden; the garden with the same non-salted, alkaline, rocky soil that my other plants are in.

This post isn’t about “oh you never know what you’ll like” or “you’ll pick up useful bits from random hobbies to apply elsewhere” or whatever. I DO believe that those statements are probably true, they just aren’t important to me. At the end of the day: I like doing stuff, and I also enjoy being good at the things I'm good at. So I want to be better at the things I’m already good at. For fun. This post is simply an exploration of what I’m good at and enjoy doing — if only to force myself to acknowledge the plants which look healthy enough to fertilize.

These are the things I want to focus my time on.
# Programming
Honestly I have always acknowledged this fella. I’ve been programming for fun and profit since I was 12, and in those 20 years have developed a great confidence and humility which basically precludes its presence in this post. This one is probably surrounded by the highest density of decaying greenery, but I have no issues with this and consider it mostly cover crop. 
# Music
I love music. Especially listening to music. And dancing. And singing. I actually do “sing” in a “band” but that’s more out of an urge to hang out with friends. And I used to “dance” competitively, but THAT plant withered away many years ago (though I have tried to resurrect it a handful of times, to no success).

But with deep affection comes deep insecurities. I am wildly self-conscious about playing music for anybody. Singing for an audience is easy because I don’t really “care” about it, and don’t really have a desire to be “good” at it — it’s just fun, and I’m with my friends, so yay! But piano or guitar…

I started playing piano when I was about 10. I took lessons etc, mostly at the insistence of my parents. I was “good” insofar as I actually practiced a bit and learned to play the music on the sheet
