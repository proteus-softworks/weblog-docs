Inspired by my wife, I’m going to set some quantifiable goals for the next year. Ultimately they will stem from some broader and less-defined goals based out of my (Dilettante’s Garden)[[the-dilettantes-garden]], but what’s more fun than checking off some boxes?
# Resolutions
- [ ] Bike 3000 miles
- [ ] Climb Alpe d’Huez

	- It can be an [Album-a-Day](https://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/)
	- It can be a full band recording
	- It can be ambient field recordings
	- Just record and publish SOMETHING
