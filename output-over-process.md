draftDate: 2026-02-24

Basically I’ve spent so long bike shedding productivity, organization, etc processes in Emacs, rolling my own tools, etc. Now I’m just leaning into simple tools I already have like Apple Calendar, Reminders, blah to just get shit out the door. I’ll never be organized, but I might as well have something to show for it.

Using obsidian for blog posts, but still just a dead simple and well supported markdown editor.
